# randomBuster
RandomBuster is a generative adversarial network (GAN) model trained on token sequences. The model learns to generate new tokens that are similar to the training data, making it useful for tasks such as text generation and language modeling. RandomBuster can be fine-tuned on specific datasets and used to generate new, realistic token sequences.
